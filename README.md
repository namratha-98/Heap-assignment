1. Build maximum heap with required methods. It should support the behaviors like adding element, getting maximum element, extracting maximum element, count number of elements and to check the method to test the heap order property.

2. Modify Q2 to sort the input in ascending order.

3. Build priority queue to handle real time tasks. Tasks can arrive at time. The attributes of tasks are task-id, priority, arrival time, execution time and deadline. Compute waiting time, turnaround time for each job. Check whether jobs are completed within the deadline specified. It is treated that 10 is maximum priority and 1 is least priority.

4. An airport is developing a computer simulation of air-traffic control that handles events such as landings and takeoffs. Each event has a time stamp that denotes the time when the event will occur with additional information like, plane number, takeoff or landing. The simulation program needs to efficiently perform the following two fundamental operations: 1. Insert an event with a given time stamp, aircraft number, takeoff / landing (add a future event). 2. Extract the event with smallest time stamp (that is, determine the next event to process). Design and implement suitable data structures that work efficiently in terms of time.
